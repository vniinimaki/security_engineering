# Week 1 Task 1
To protect myself from cyber crimes I've taken measures in both technical sense and concisous sense.

For account management I either use generated strong passwords with password manager or create passwords that are strong and not affected by social engineering (i.e. not connected to my publicly available information). I often use two factor authentication when available for important account. 
Generally when operating on the internet, I have a mindset of being sure of the identitity of the actors I interact with. I have a pretty good idea of how certain services operate so I tend to notice suspicious behaviour.

Luckily, I have not been a victim of any cyber crime as far as I know. I have encountered a lot of phishing attacks through SMS and email but none have been convincing enough for me to fall for them.
